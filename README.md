# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## üìå Project Overview
This project develops a **Machine Learning model** to detect fraudulent transactions for a financial company. The dataset consists of **6,362,620 rows and 10 columns**, containing transaction details. The model leverages **Random Forest Classifier** along with **Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest & LOF)** to enhance fraud detection. 

## üìä Dataset Information
The dataset contains the following key features:
- **`step`** - Time unit in hours (1 step = 1 hour).
- **`type`** - Type of transaction (`CASH-IN`, `CASH-OUT`, `DEBIT`, `PAYMENT`, `TRANSFER`).
- **`amount`** - Transaction amount in local currency.
- **`nameOrig`** - Customer initiating the transaction.
- **`oldbalanceOrg`** - Initial balance before the transaction.
- **`newbalanceOrig`** - New balance after the transaction.
- **`nameDest`** - Customer receiving the transaction.
- **`oldbalanceDest`** - Initial balance of recipient before the transaction.
- **`newbalanceDest`** - New balance of recipient after the transaction.
- **`isFraud`** - **(Target Variable)** Indicates whether the transaction is fraudulent.
- **`isFlaggedFraud`** - Flags transactions over 200,000 as illegal.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
‚úî **Missing Values**: Removed all missing values using `df.dropna()`.  
‚úî **Outlier Detection**: Used **Interquartile Range (IQR)** to remove extreme values.  
‚úî **Multi-Collinearity Check**: Visualized correlations using a **heatmap**.

## üèóÔ∏è Model Development
The fraud detection model is built using **Random Forest Classifier** along with **Anomaly Detection** techniques:
- **Isolation Forest**: Identifies unusual transaction patterns by isolating rare events.
- **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: Detects anomalies based on neighborhood density.

**Feature Engineering**:
- Created `balance_change` = `oldbalanceOrg` - `newbalanceOrig`
- Created `recipient_balance_change` = `oldbalanceDest` - `newbalanceDest`
- Encoded categorical variables (transaction `type`) using **one-hot encoding**.

## üìà Model Performance Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the following **metrics**:
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score** (Classification Report)
- **AUC-ROC Score** (Ability to distinguish fraud from non-fraud)
- **Feature Importance Analysis** to determine key fraud indicators.

‚úÖ **Trained model is saved for reuse**:  
```python
joblib.dump(model, "fraud_detection_model.pkl")
```
